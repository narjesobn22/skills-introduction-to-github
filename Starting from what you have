#Starting from What You Have
Starting from what we have consider as the hardest part about transforming a private software project into a public, free and open-source software project. Our team has chosen the project developed during the Internet and Development course, ITCS333, known as the Basta website system. Initially developed and programmed as proprietary software, it is now the opportune moment to advance to the next stage which is transforming the project for public use, ensuring compatibility across various computing platforms. 
The primary objective of this transition is to concentrate on elevating and refining customer service and experience.
